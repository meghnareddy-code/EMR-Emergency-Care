# EMR-Emergency-Care

The project's scope centers on the creation of a comprehensive database system serving as the backend for a simplified EMR system, focusing specifically on the emergency department. This initiative entails the construction of a UML diagram and a well-structured database schema consisting of various interconnected tables, encompassing key components such as addresses, insurance details, provider information, facility records, patient profiles, visit logs, clinical data, appointment schedules, orders, bed management, supply inventory, and billing data. Each table will be equipped with unique attributes and primary keys, establishing associations through foreign keys to facilitate data relationships. The database will enable users to input and manage essential patient demographic information, provider details, visit logs, clinical data, and other relevant data based on specific emergency scenarios. Additionally, it will support data editing for rectifying entry errors or updating legitimate information, along with robust search functionalities based on patient names, IDs, and visit dates. The system will also be equipped with reporting capabilities, facilitating the identification of patients meeting specific criteria.

Presented is a database design tailored for an emergency Electronic Health Records (EHR) system, encompassing 12 distinct tables, each representing a discrete entity within the emergency EHR framework. Each table is equipped with a primary key, ensuring the unique identification of every entry, while inter-table relationships are established through the use of foreign keys. For instance, the "ADDRESSES" and "INSURANCES" tables incorporate foreign keys referencing the "PATIENTS" table, whereas the "VISITS" table integrates foreign keys linked to the "PATIENTS," "PROVIDERS," and "FACILITIES" tables.
The "CLINICAL INFORMATION" table captures and logs pertinent clinical data derived from patient visits, including symptoms, discharge diagnoses, and administered medications. The "ORDERS" table documents the tests prescribed for patients during their visits, while the "BEDS" table catalogs information concerning hospital beds, detailing their respective types.
Furthermore, the "BILLING" table houses essential information pertaining to the billing process of patient visits, recording details such as the visit ID and corresponding billing amount. This table is intricately linked to the "VISITS" table through a foreign key association, facilitating seamless tracking of billing information for each individual visit.
In essence, this database design furnishes a comprehensive and methodical approach to securely store and manage patient and clinical data within an emergency EHR system. It enables the efficient monitoring of patient visits, clinical specifics, appointment scheduling, and billing processes, while facilitating convenient access to pertinent data regarding healthcare providers, facilities, bed allocations, and inventory supplies.
